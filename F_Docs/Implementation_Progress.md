# Implementation Progress

## 2026-04-29 - FinalRun RunDeck instance migration step 1

- `FFinalRunState.RunDeck` is now the single run deck truth source and stores `FFinalRunCardInstance` entries instead of raw `FFinalCardId` values.
- Each run deck card keeps `BaseCardId`, `CurrentCardId`, `OwnerCharacterId`, `EvolutionStage`, and `TimesPlayedThisRun`.
- Battle start remains compatible with the current battle layer: `BuildBattleStartRequest()` still outputs `DeckCardIds`, derived from each card instance's `CurrentCardId`.
- Existing reward deck edits now operate on card instances:
  - card grant creates a new run card instance;
  - remove-card removes the first matching effective card id;
  - upgrade-card updates `CurrentCardId` on the matching instance.
- No growth-choice generation, attribute growth, UI, battle fact integration, or hand refresh logic is implemented in this step.
